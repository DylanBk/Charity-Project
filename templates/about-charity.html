                <div class="container-content">
                    <p>YoungMinds is a charity based in the UK aiming to help young people with their mental health. Notably, they are focused on providing support to those who are minoritised and marginalised in the UK. YoungMinds creates a platform for those in need to be heard and gives them the tools to look after their mental health. Adults are also guided on how to help young people best. Their mission is to build a world where no young person feels alone or unable to express their mental health.</p>

                <div class="container-content">
                    <p>YoungMinds' strategy involves several stages; the initial step is to teach young people how to look after themselves, mentally. The charity advises young people in need on how to make the best decisions and their next step to a positive mindset.
                    <br><br>The second stage is to ensure that young people are surrounded by adults to whom they can confide any mental health issues. Many young people do not have anyone to talk to about their mental health, and this needs to change.
                    <br><br>The third and final step is to establish a movement led by young people to inform others of the importance of mental health and to provide support and reassurance. Using young people as the voice of change is pivotal as young people are more likely to listen to each other when it comes to mental health.
                    <br><br>The end goal of this programme is to create a world where young people are always in a positive environment and able to talk to others about their mental health.</p>
